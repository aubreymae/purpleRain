	<h3>Project Brief</h3>
	<p>Moon Box is an interactive light installation that uses atmospheric data to create a simulation of a fantastical dimension within a closed box. The participant must insert their head through a circular opening at the bottom of a "floating" black box. Based on the moon gate which is an architectural element found in many houses and gardens in Chinese culture, Moon Box functions like an entrance and a portal to a new space. Like the moon gate, Moon Box's role is to be the dividing archway between two differing spaces or realities.</p>

	<h3>Specifications</h3>
	<p>Recreating a fantastical reality within the box was paramount to the project. As a result, the inside walls of Moon Box are laced with mirrors and LED clouds were hung on the ceiling and the floor. The LED clouds are characteristic of Chinese mythological stories, in which clouds are used as vessels of transportation for figures of nobility and myths like dragons and deities. In essence, moon gates are the vessels of transportation between two spaces and Moon Box aims to transport participants to a fantasy while staying within their reality.</p>
