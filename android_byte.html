	<h3>Project Brief</h3>
	<p>DMByte is a mobile chat-bot app that aims to assist Digital Media at York University students by acting as an academic counsellor, ready to answer degree-completion question and concerns. The application incorporates customization for each student, users can select a profile picture and create an account login. The chatbot is capable of answering questions relating to digital media via keywords (eg. general education, DATT, NATS). Another feature is the capability of storing a studentâ€™s degree record in order to guide with degree completion. The student has the ability to reference their degree completion in the database at any time.</p>
