	<h3>Project Brief</h3>
	<p><i>You are a poor, little, abandoned alley cat in the middle of a worn down city trying to survive the perils of a dangerous ally in the city. You fight your way to the top of the ally against all odds to the adulation and praise of all the other abandoned cats in the city! The odds are stacked against you as youâ€™re a small cat in a big city but with will and determination, you can reach the top of the city and conquer it for yourself!</i></p>
